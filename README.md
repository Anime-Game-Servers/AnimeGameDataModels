# AnimeGameDataModels (WIP)

This repo will contain the full definition, handling and documentation of all the binout/Excel data the anime game client and servers are using, together with some custom definitions.
It will also help with reading and writing them from and to the target formats (currently supported: JSON)

Usage
=====

## Include version in your project
Add the ags maven repository to your project. 
For release versions use the following:
```groovy
maven {
    name "agsmvnReleases"
    url "https://mvn.animegameservers.org/releases"
}
```

For snapshots use the following:
```groovy
maven {
    name = "agsmvnSnapshots"
    url = "https://mvn.animegameservers.org/snapshots"
}
```

Then include the dependency in your project:
```groovy
implementation("org.anime_game_servers.data_models:loader:$version") // For the basic loader of the resource files
implementation("org.anime_game_servers.data_models:GIData:$version") // For the model definitions for the GI anime game
```
of with a version toml file:
```toml
[versions]
anime_game_data_models = "$version"

[libraries]
# For the basic loader of the resource files
ags-datamodels_loader = { module = "org.anime_game_servers.data_models:loader", version.ref = "anime_game_data_models" }
# For the model definitions for the GI anime game
ags-datamodels_gidata = { module = "org.anime_game_servers.data_models:GIData ", version.ref = "anime_game_data_models" }
```
